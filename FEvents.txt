The Council of Elrond has gathered in Rivendell to decide what should be done with the One Ring. Gandalf insists that it must be destroyed, although the only way to do it is to cast it into the flames of Mount Doom near the Black Castle of Barad-dur in the heart of Mordor. Brave Frodo volunteers to carry it there himself. Gimli, Legolas, and Boromir offer him their help. They form the Fellowship of the Ring and set out together on the dangerous quest.
^
********
^
First the Fellowship needs to go south and enter the mines of Moria which is the only passage to the other side of Ered Luin mountains. They may hope for help and healing from Lorien before they continue further south to look for the secret pass of Cirith Ungol and infiltrate Mordor. Once they reach Mount Doom the One Ring can be used against the otherwise undefeatable Barad-dur.
