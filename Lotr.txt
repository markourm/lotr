^^Length: %STRING1 to %STRING2
^It is almost the end of the Third Age - 3018 Gondor Reckoning or 1418 Hobbit 
Reckoning. It is the beginning of the Great Years.  Sauron's armies have grown 
tremendous under his rule and all Middle Earth is slowly falling under their might. 
His servants plunder and corrupt the land and no city is safe from his terror. 
His nearly indestructible Ringwraiths have shown themselves for the first time in 
many years. In Mordor he has forged alliances with the Harad peoples in the South and 
with the Rhun peoples in the East. 
^Only one obstacle remains between Sauron and the domination of Middle Earth - he needs 
the One Ring to regain his full power. Already he knows it lies in the hands of a small 
and rather insignificant hobbit... 
^The powerful wizard Saruman in Isengard behaves strangely as of late 
and no one knows whose cause he serves or what are his intentions... 
^Can the good and uncorrupted people still find allies and muster their 
strength to stand up against the evil Dark Lord or will they fall as have 
so many before them?  
@end -- this line must be here!
